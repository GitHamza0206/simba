## What is Simba?

Simba is a powerful document processing platform that extracts structured data from unstructured documents. The Simba Client provides a convenient Python interface to the Simba API, allowing you to:

- Upload and manage documents
- Parse documents to extract text, tables, entities, and form data
- Process documents both synchronously and asynchronously
- Retrieve and manage parsing results

## Key Features

- **Document Management**: Upload, download, list, and delete documents
- **Flexible Parsing**: Extract valuable information from documents
- **Synchronous & Asynchronous Processing**: Choose the processing mode that fits your needs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and reporting
- **Type Annotations**: Full Python type hints for better IDE integration

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A valid API key for a Simba server
- Internet connection to communicate with the API

## Where to Go Next

If you're new to the Simba Client, we recommend starting with the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) followed by the [Quick Start Tutorial](./quickstart.md).
