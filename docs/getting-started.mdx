## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Redis 7.0+**
- **Node.js 20+** (for the frontend)
- **Git**
- **Poetry** (for Python dependency management)

## Quick Installation

### Option 1: Install with pip

The simplest way to get started with Simba is to install the client SDK:

```bash
pip install simba-core
```

### Option 2: Clone the Repository

For a complete installation, including the backend and frontend:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitHamza0206/simba.git
cd simba
poetry install
```

## Running Simba

### Backend Service

To start the Simba backend service:

```bash
# In a new terminal, start Simba
simba server 
```

By default, the backend will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Frontend (Optional)

If you want to use the UI:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.

### Running Parsing Algorithms

Simba leverages advanced parsing algorithms, such as Docling, to transform unstructured documents into structured formats suitable for efficient retrieval and analysis. To run the parsing process, execute:

```bash
simba parse
```


## Basic Usage

### Connecting to Simba

Here's a simple example of connecting to Simba using the SDK:

```python
from simba_sdk import SimbaClient

# Initialize the client
client = SimbaClient(api_url="http://localhost:8000")

# Check connection
status = client.health()
print(f"Simba status: {status}")
```

### Adding a Document

To add a document to your knowledge base:

```python
# Upload a file
document = client.documents.create(file_path="path/to/your/document.pdf")
document_id = document[0]["id"]
print(f"Document uploaded with ID: {document_id}")

# List all documents
all_docs = client.documents.list()
print(f"Total documents: {len(all_docs)}")
```

### Retrieving Knowledge

To retrieve information from your knowledge base:

```python
# Basic retrieval
results = client.retrieval.retrieve(
    query="What is Simba?",
    top_k=3  # Number of chunks to retrieve
)

# Display results
for chunk in results:
    print(f"Score: {chunk['score']}")
    print(f"Content: {chunk['content']}")
    print("---")
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have Simba up and running, here are some next steps:

- Learn more about [configuring Simba](/configuration)
- Explore [vector stores](/core-concepts/vector-stores) for optimized retrieval
- Understand [embeddings](/core-concepts/embeddings) and how they work
- Customize the [chunking process](/core-concepts/chunking) for your specific needs
- Check out our [examples](/examples/document-ingestion) for more advanced usage

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

- Ensure Redis is running and accessible
- Check that all prerequisites are installed
- Verify port availability for both backend (8000) and frontend (5173)
